# SAMPLE CODE FOR A PROJECT
demo code  for conference room automation


Hello Folks,

Please refer to the main.cpp for the entire source code that I had used for Conference Room Automation. Please note that the src code 
does not have any FreeRTOS libraries or Nordic drivers that are needed to successfully implement the code.

Thanks,
Sujay.
